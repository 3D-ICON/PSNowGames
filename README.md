# PSNowGames
Game List for PS Now Games


This is a short script for fetching available games on the Playstation Now platform by Sony.


Necessary modules for the script: requests, html2json, bs4, bs2json, ast

Install them via pip to your Python environment.

You can run the Gamelist PS Now new.ipynb" file with Jupyter Notebook.

Otherwise run "app2.py" with Python. It has a better database than the first script.
```sh
$ python app2.py
```

In both cases a new "psnowgamelist.csv" file will be created with all the games.
