Game List for PS Now Games


This is a short script for fetching available games on the Playstation Now platform by Sony.


Necessary modules for the script: requests, html2json, bs4, bs2json, ast

Install them via pip to your Python environment.

You can run the "PS Now Gameslist 2.ipynb" file with Jupyter Notebook.

Otherwise run "app.py" with Python.

In both cases a new "psnowgamelist.csv" file will be created with all the games.
